    <h2>The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      This is the best sugar cookie recipe and the only one I use. Whenever you
      make these cookies for someone, be sure to bring along several copies of
      the recipe â€” you will be asked for it, I promise! Note: I make icing with
      confectioners' sugar and milk. I make it fairly thin, as I "paint" the
      icing on the cookies with a pastry brush. Thin enough to spread easily but
      not so thin that it just makes your cookies wet and runs off.
